# Analysing-Churn-using-Python
I Analysed and visualised the big data of a European Telecom company  using Python and Matplotlib to investigate churn 

Customer Churn is a major issue in every industry and one of the biggest worries for the telecom sector.

Because of the significant negative impact that customer churn has on businesses' earnings, particularly in the telecom industry, many businesses are working to create predictive models of client attrition.

Customer retention has now overtaken customer acquisition as the most crucial factor in this highly competitive market. The telecoms sector sees an average yearly churn rate of 15–25%, and it costs 5–10 times more to acquire a new client than it does to keep an existing one.

Consequently, identifying the causes of client churn is crucial to taking the appropriate steps to lower it.

My project's major objective is to create an understanding of customer churn's causes, which helps telecom operators estimate which customers are most likely to churn and what to do to keep the most valued customers.
